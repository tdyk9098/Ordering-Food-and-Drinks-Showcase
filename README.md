# Interactive Food and Drink Order Script
Showcase of Python basics: Ordering food and drinks


I had fun creating this while learning the basics of loops.

This project / script is an interactive food and drinks ordering experience. 

The user is provided with three menu options: fries, drinks, and  burgers.

The fries and drinks have three size options, while the burger has three burger style options.

This script is a showcase of strings, lists, dictionaries, loops, and nested IF statements.
